# Overview
This is a very fast auto-correct (AutoHotKey script) that corrects any highlighted text in mere milliseconds with the speed and performance of Groq, currently only functional on Windows.

# Versatility
This can be used with other providers as well when augmenting the payload to adapt to other providers such as Cerebras, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more. (These will be integrated later on as progress continues.)

# How to Setup
It is *very* easy to set this up, and it is a one-time setup process. All you need to do is:
1. Download and install AutoHotKey at their site [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Sign up for the free tier of Groq right [here](https://console.groq.com/authenticate/signup).
3. Get your API key from the "API Keys" section of the dashboard on Groq.
4. Place the newly created key in the string for the `API_KEY` towards the top of the file.
5. Save and run the file; if it is not defaulting to the AutoHotkey application, ensure you open it via that.

# How to Use
This was built to be the most rapid, efficient, and useful text correction tool. You can easily correct any text with any set of grammatical, typo, and punctuation errors with the following steps:
1. Highlight the text (usually `Ctrl + A` to select all works quickly).
2. Press `Ctrl + Alt + R`, which is where the magic happens.
3. That's it! Your text will be corrected nearly instantly with the speed and precision of Kimi K2 on Groq.

# Use-Cases for This
Some may find it unnecessary if they type well or already have automatic autocorrect, but this is very useful for a wide array of purposes:
- Some tools have poor auto-correct or *no* auto-correct support — this works there.
- You need to fix dozens or even *hundreds* of errors/typos in text; this will fix all of them in one go if you highlight and use the command!

I hope this is useful for anyone dealing with annoying mistakes when writing long sentences or paragraphs. It quickly polishes up almost everything I write in Discord, Twitter, Notion, and more, and I love using it a *ton*!
